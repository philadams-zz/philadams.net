Readings and summaries for the big paper.

- feb 18 (not steckel)
- mar 4
- house' structure and theory of social support!
- handbooks of stress science (contrada and baum)

Stress theory
-------------

Largely, from the directed reading under Elaine Wethington.

### Themes and questions

Themes:

- the meaning and manifestations of stress
- sources of stress
- the measurement of stress
- resources mediating stress
- the stress process, source to manifestation
- outcomes or impacts (long-term like depression? short-term
  like conflict resolution? other?)

Questions:

- other than pearlin, stress is poorly defined, or not all - why? and it
  seems different words often mean the same or similar things (x-stress)
- how is 'vulnerability to stress' operationalized?
- how/do we account for feedback loops? (e.g. can damanged self
  concepts be both sources and symptoms of distress?)
- how is/has our understanding of stress been changing? when did we
  start exploring stress? where are we headed now?
- i like having author's pictures in the paper! and four columns is a
  lot of text
- how is mellin's stress scale (e.g. like in taylor) cited? is it?
  actually call it the taylor 1-item measure, and cite the taylor cultural differences paper

Answers:

- social support and coping are processes that work together
- thoits does a lot of work matching support to the problem
- social support big names: thoits and uchino
- definitions for stress converge on Turner's usage - use these! match
  selye
- vulnerability to stress: the residual, what's left over after
  controlling for exposure (as much as you can)
- feedback loops - hard to statistically and longitudinally measure
  (e.g. minimum of three times of observation)
- where is stress going? merging qualitative reports with environmental
  / context / environment - what are the pollutants? noise level?
  crowding? and trying to get these objectively.
- sociologists like the long-term big impacts, psychologists often stay
  to small daily changes. connecting these would be a good reading -
  stereotype threat might be a good exemplar of how this might be done
- selective optimization/compensation field would be a good place to
  explore transactions and dynamics in stress
- read soyae and walter cannon

### The readings

<h4>Pearlin, 1981. The stress process</h4>

Using longitudinal interview data, this paper shows how sources of
stress (life events, chronic life strains) and stress-mediating
resources (coping, social supports) come together with self concepts
(self-esteem, master) to form the stress process. Specifically, life
events affect role strains which erode self concepts, leaving one
vulnerable to experiencing manifestations of stress. Resources
intervene indirectly by impacting specific parts of the process.
Describing how antecedents of stress converge is more productive than
examining them in isolation.

<h4>Turner, 1995. The epidemiology of social stress</h4>

Differences in stress exposure account for 23-50% of differences in
mental health (depression) by sex, marital status, and occupation;
distributions of stress exposure over sex, age, marital status and
occupational status correspond to distributions of depressive symptoms
over the same factors. The impact of stress exposure had previously been
underestimated relative to a measure of vulnerability to stress.

<h4>Almeida and Wethington, 2002. The daily inventory of stressful
events (DISE)</h4>

This study introduces the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events, an
semistructred interview measurement of multiple aspects of daily
stressors. The DISE is then used to asses the prevelance of daily
stressors in a sample of US adults: the most common stressors were
interpersonal tension followed by work-related stressors for men and
network stress (events occurring close to others) for women. The study
also showed that specific stressor types are associated significantly
with mood and health symptoms.

<h4>Cohen, 2012. Who's stressed? Distributions of psychological stress
in the United States in probability samples from 1983, 2006, and 2009</h4>

This study reports the association of psychological stress (PSS-10) with
sex, education, and income in 1983, 2006, and 2009. In all three
surveys, stress was higher among men and increased with decreasing age,
education, and income. The economic slump of 2008-09 had little impact,
except for middle-aged college-educated white men with full time
employment.

<h4>Folkman, 1986. Dynamics of a stress encounter: Cognitive
appraisal, coping, and encounter outcomes</h4>

Presents associations between primary appraisal (what is at stake),
secondary appraisal (coping options), eight types of problem and emotion
focused coping strategies, and outcomes for stressful encounters
experienced in daily life. The type of coping used is related to both
what is at stake, and the available coping options; for example, higher
stakes are associated with self-control, escape-avoidance, and seeking
social support as coping strategies. Problem focused coping was more
common in encounters appraised as changeable, while for encounters where
affecting the outcome seemed difficult, coping was more emotion focused.

<h4>Wethington, 1986. Perceived social support, received support, and
adjustment to stressful life events</h4>

This study investigates the relative impacts of perceived social support
(perception of support availability) and actual received social support,
and concludes that perceived support may be at least as important, if
not more so. Perceived support may also be at play among self-reliant
copers: although support mobilization is needed only when personal
coping strategies fail, Brown (1978) found that self-reliant copers
maintain strong ties to support networks - it is possible that a
perception of available support allows self-reliant copers to be riskier
and more single-minded in issue resolution than they would otherwise.

<h4>Taylor, 2000. Psychological resources, positive illusions, and
health</h4>

This study shows early evidence for the role of positive psychology
(optimisim, personal control, and a sense of meaning) in protecting not
just mental health, but also physical health. This is true of even
unrealistically optimistic beliefs about the future - in fact, realistic
acceptance of liklihood of death in HIV patients is associated with a
faster course of disease. While the biological routes explaining this
mechanism remain largely unknown, the authors reference several
suggestions including stress and affect's impact on the autonomic
nervous system.

<h4>Aronson, 2013. Unhealthy interactions: the role of stereotype threat
in health disparities</h4>

This essay describes stereotype threat (a disruptive psychological
state that people experience when they feel at risk for confirming a
negative stereotype as sociated with their social identity - their race,
gender, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, etc.) and its
impact in health disparities by social identity. Drawing on successful
interventions in education, the article also outlines techniques for
reducing harm due to stereotype threat in clinics and hospitals (e.g.
presence of role models exhibiting counter-stereotypical traits,
effective feedback giving, common courtesy and warmth, making explicit
the inclusive nature of the clinic). The stereotype threat model is
diagrammed, and much intervention targets providing cues that disconfirm
the precense of the stereotype.

<h4>House, 1988. Structures and processes of social support</h4>

This canonical article describes and details the structures and theories
behind social support, and their relevance to social relationships and
health.

<h4>Seeman, 1996. Impact of social environment characteristics on
neuroendocrine regulation</h4>

<h4>Berkman, 2000. From social integration to health: Durkheim in the
new mellenium</h4>

<h4>Taylor, 2007. Cultural differences in the impact of social support
on psychological and biological response</h4>

This article distinguishes between explicit social support (seeking and
using advice and emotional solace) and implicit social support (focusing
on valued social groups without seeking and using explicit advice), and
explores their relative effectiveness in Asian and Asian-Americans
compared to European-Americans. Likely due to the collective vs
individualistic cultural foci, implicit social support is more effective
for Asians and Asian-Americans, while explicit social support is more
effective for European-Americans. Indeed, being exposed to the
alternative type of social support may in fact increase stress. The
authors carefully distinguish between implicit social support and
Wethington's perceived social support, the key discriminator being in
perceived social support the explicit support is avaiable and may well later be
taken advantage of; this is not the case with implicit support.
