> Our strength grows out of our weakness. Not until we are pricked
> andstung and sorely shot at, awakens the indignation which arms itself
> withsecret forces. A great man is always willing to be little. Whilst
> hesits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he is
> pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he
> has been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns

> and real skill. The wise man always throws himself on the side of his
> assailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak
