Hi, I'm Phil Adams
==================

I'm a PhD candidate in [Cornell University][cornell]'s [Information Science
Department][infosci]. My research interests are in social and mobile computing
with a focus on small and brief moments of interaction; my dissertation work is
on the _in situ_ momentary measurement of affect, stress, and chronic pain.

I'm also interested in how and why people participate in online communities
(and why they don't!), in brief moments of socially supportive behavior, in
terse visualizations affording glimpses of (personal) data, and in the capture
and sharing of images for communication and self-assessment. [Here's my
resume](./resume.pdf) (.pdf).

I enjoy [brief and powerful thoughts](./quotes).
