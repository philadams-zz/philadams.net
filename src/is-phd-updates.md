We’re growing into a medium-sized department. And we’re all friendly and often
hang out socially. That’s awesome! But, we can sometimes lose track of what
everyone’s working on. Which is sad, because everyone’s work is so very
interesting! Being more aware of one another’s projects, reading groups,
research directions, and more should also continue to foster our cross-domain
conversations and collaborations.

These updates reflect a small, non-invasive, super low-cost way to help IS
grads feel more in touch with each others’ research projects. Toward the end of
each month, we’ll invite you to share a few lines (max!) about what you have
been up to for the past month and/or what you are planning for the upcoming
month - for example, "reading loads on privacy literature right now and will
look more into surveillance studies next month", or "running a field trial
investigating novel ESM-style pain self-report interfaces". On the first of
that month, we’ll send the updates to _isrumgone_.

These updates are informal and totally optional. They are intended to be shared
only with other PhD students.
