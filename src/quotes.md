> no trouble. _W.H. Auden_

- 
> The truth is like a lion. You don't have to defend it. Let it loose.

> [The successful person] is always prepared. Even in failure, he is composed.
> He is not easily discouraged. [He] considers his struggles to be a kind of
> sport, and he approaches them as he would a game. He contends with life’s
> difficulties in a relaxed and pleasant manner. He keeps a clear head even
> when things go wrong. And please believe me when I tell you: successful
> people are never sore losers; they’re the ones who don’t whine and give up
> after every failure. Indeed, they are the ones who keep their chins up,
> weather life’s misfortunes, and live to fight another day. _Walter Benjamin_

> The antidote to fear is trust, and we all have a desire to find something to
> trust in an uncertain world. Fear and trust are powerful forces, and while
> they are not opposites, exactly, trust is the best tool for driving out fear.
> There will always be plenty to be afraid of, especially when you are doing
> something new. Trusting others doesn’t mean that they won’t make mistakes. It
> means that if they do (or if you do), you trust they will act to help solve
> it. Fear can be created quickly; trust can’t. Leaders must demonstrate their
> trustworthiness, over time, through their actions — and the best way to do
> that is by responding well to failure. _Ed Catmull_

- 
> We need to think about failure differently. I’m not the first to say that
> failure, when approached properly, can be an opportunity for growth. But the
> way most people interpret this assertion is that mistakes are a necessary
> evil. Mistakes aren’t a necessary evil. They aren’t evil at all. They are an
> inevitable consequence of doing something new (and, as such, should be seen
> as valuable; without them, we’d have no originality). And yet, even as I say
> that embracing failure is an important part of learning, I also acknowledge
> that acknowledging this truth is not enough. That’s because failure is
> painful, and our feelings about this pain tend to screw up our understanding
> of its worth. To disentangle the good and the bad parts of failure, we have
> to recognize both the reality of the pain and the benefit of the resulting
> growth. _Ed Catmull_

> Things you own end up owning you. _Tyler Durden_

- 
> Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be
> getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look
> for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of
> ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and
> true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for
> stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not
> going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that
> allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their
> lives. _Carol Dweck_

- 
> I never worry about the future it comes soon enough. _Albert Einstein_

- 
> Our strength grows out of our weakness. Not until we are pricked
> and stung and sorely shot at, awakens the indignation which arms itself
> with secret forces. A great man is always willing to be little. Whilst
> he sits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he is
> pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he
> has been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns
> his ignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation
> and real skill. The wise man always throws himself on the side of his
> assailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak
> point. The wound cicatrizes and falls off from him like a dead skin
> and when they would triumph, lo! he has passed on invulnerable. Blame
> is safer than praise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as
> all that is said is said against me, I feel a certain assurance of
> success.  But as soon as honied words of praise are spoken for me I
> feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies. In general,
> every evil to which we do not succumb is a benefactor. As the
> Sandwich Islander believes that the strength and valor of the enemy he
> kills passes into himself, so we gain the strength of the temptation
> we resist. _Ralph Waldo Emerson, Essays V: Compensation, 1841_

- 
> That's the paradox: the only time most people feel alive is when they’re

> why the things that are worst to undergo are the best to remember" _Ted
> Hughes_

- 
> The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much
> they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated. And the
> only thing people regret is that they didn't live boldly enough, that they
> didn't invest enough heart, didn't love enough. Nothing else really counts at
> all. _Ted Hughes_

- 
> Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of
> things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do
> takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration. _Donald Knuth_

- 
> Mastery requires endurance. Mastery, a word we don’t use often, is not the
> equivalent of what we might consider its cognate — perfectionism — an inhuman
> aim motivated by a concern with how others view us. Mastery is also not the
> same as success — an event-based victory based on a peak point, a punctuated
> moment in time. Mastery is not merely a commitment to a goal, but to a
> curved-line, constant pursuit. _Sarah Lewis_

-

> years. _Abraham Lincoln_
