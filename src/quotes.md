> assailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak
> point. The wound cicatrizes and falls off from him like a dead skin
> and when they would triumph, lo! he has passed on invulnerable. Blame
> is safer than praise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as
> all that is said is said against me, I feel a certain assurance of
